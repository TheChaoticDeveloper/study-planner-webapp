# Study Planner Web App

## Overview
The Study Planner is a web-based application designed to help students or non-students manage their academic workload by organizing tasks, tracking deadlines, and prioritizing assignments efficiently.

This project was created as a back-up for my IB personal project in-case if the 'AI study planner' didn't work.
